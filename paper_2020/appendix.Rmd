## Supplementary figure

For Matt to do!

Basic idea:

- Compare relative SD (relative to NS) for NS2, NS3, (and SSR2, SSR3??) with second_slide_costs of 0.1, 0.6, 1

- Also vary the CV partitions to e.g. swap slide and within, and slide and between

- Try to come up with a single graph to summarise this...


Figure S1:  Figure NS3 and SSR3 NS1x2 and SSR1x2 for second slide cost of 0.1/0.6/1 - same as figure 1??

Look at two pre-treatment samples i.e. 2x1

## Fixed parameters:
R <- 5e2  #3
budget <- 1200
cv_between <- 1.5
cv_within <- 0.75
cv_slide <- 0.25
cv_reduction <- 0
true_prevalence <- 1
# Overall k is about 0.23
combined_k(cv_between, cv_within, cv_slide, cv_reduction)


```
